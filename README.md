# MotionPose

Do later

## Description

This README is aimed to help users with all levels of coding experience, from downloading code-editors to package dependencies that the project will need to run. Feel free to submit any concerns or questions [here](https://forms.gle/jqhrSSzZc9947NS2A)

## Set-Up

### Cloning the MotionPose Project

1. **Download VSCode**

   [Download VSCode Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). VSCode is a code editor where you will run the MotionPose project.

3.  **Clone MotionPose**

    Now you want to clone the MotionPose project to your local machine.

    Open up VS Code and go to source control. If git is properly installed, you will be able to connect your GitHub with VS Code.

    Here you can either use the VS Code interface to find the project or you can paste the HTTP GitHub repository for the project into the search bar where it says "Provide repository URL or pick a repository source":

        https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME.>/motionpose.git

![Go to Source (1)](https://github.com/michael01890/motionpose/assets/124008592/fe4911bf-d3eb-457c-8d07-74161387c6b0)

![Go to Source (3)](https://github.com/michael01890/motionpose/assets/124008592/149778e5-9dc8-4012-b43b-71d7886de31b)

Now you should have all the project files on your local machine!

### Installing Dependencies

The project runs on three main files: main.py, ws_socket.py, and Sketch.js.

**ws_socket.py**
This file is the WebSocket server that will take in the coordinates generated by the object detection and depth estimation model and send it to our front end.

**main.py**
This file contains the model for our depth estimation and object detection. When you run this file, python will utilize MediaPipe to

- Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Executing program

1. Start the server:
   Open up a terminal from the root directory and run the following command:

```
python ws_server.py
```

2. Start the client: Open a second terminal (while the other is still running) and type the following command:

```
python main.py
```

3. Start the frontend: First make sure you have the Live Server extension installed. In the bottom right corner of VS Code there should be a "Go Live" button. Click this and a tab in your web browser will open.

   If you don't have the "Go Live" button navigate to the left panel and find extensions. From there download the Live Server extension.
